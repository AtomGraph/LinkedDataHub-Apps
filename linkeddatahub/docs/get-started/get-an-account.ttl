    <div>
        <h2 id="get-webid">Get WebID</h2>
        <p>LinkedDataHub uses WebID as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_sign-on" target="_blank">Single sign-on</a> (SSO)
            protocol for distributed applications, which is based on authentication using TLS client certficates. Using WebID, you will be able to authenticate with every LinkedDataHub application. 
            <a href="http://webid.info" target="_blank">Read more about WebID</a>.</p>
        <div class="alert alert-info">
            <p>Unlike most LinkedDataHub resources, your WebID profile will have <em>public access</em> as required by the
            protocol. We will hide your email address however.</p>

                <p>If you have completed the <a href="../setup/">setup</a>, <samp>certs/owner.p12</samp> is your WebID certificate. Password is the <samp>OWNER_KEY_PASSWORD</samp> value from the <samp>.env</samp> file.</p>

                    <p>If you already have a WebID, you can use it for this purpose and skip the rest of this section. If you do not have a WebID, LinkedDataHub
                        will create one for you when you sign up.</p>
                </div>
                <p>To sign up, click on the <span class="btn btn-primary">Sign up</span> on any of the LinkedDataHub applications. You will be
                    asked to fill basic details about yourself and your affiliation and provide a password for the certficate (at
                    least 6 characters long). After this is completed successfully, your WebID is created and stored in the
                    <a href="../manage-apps/#admin-apps">admin application</a>, and an email message is sent to the specified email
                    address with the certificate attached to it.</p>

            <h3 id="install-cert">Install certificate</h3>
            <p>The final step is to install the client certificate into your web browser. It is done by importing the <samp>.p12</samp>
                file using the browser's certificate manager and providing the password that you supplied during signup. The
                manager dialog can be opened following the steps below, depending on which browser you use (instructions are for
                the latest versions as of October 2017):</p>

                <dt>Apple Safari</dt>
                <dd>The file is installed directly into the operating system. Open the file and import it using the

            </dl>
            <p>You need to install the certificate on all devices/browsers that you are using to access LinkedDataHub.</p>

    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 id="log-in">Log in</h2>
        <p>With the certificate installed, there is no login procedure â€” you are automatically <em>authenticated</em> on all
            LinkedDataHub applications. This is known as Single sign-on (SSO).</p>
        <p>Applications can provide public access to some or all documents, meaning you can freely browse their public resources
            and perform actions that are allowed for public access. In order to access protected (non-public) resources, as well
            as to access administration application, users have to be authenticated as well <em>authorized</em> (authorizations
            can be <a href="../administration/acl/#auth-requests">requested</a>).</p>
        <div class="alert alert-info">
            <p>Authenticated agents <em>are not guaranteed to have access</em> to all resources. Different access levels for
                different agents can be specified by the application administrators.</p>
