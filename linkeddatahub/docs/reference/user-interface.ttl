    <p class="lead">This guide walks through the main features of LinkedDataHub user interface.
        See <a href="../documents/">Document management</a> guide for basic definitions such as application and document.</p>
    <div class="alert alert-info">
        <p>User interface is only one of the interfaces LinkedDataHub provides. The other one is the <a href="../command-line-interface/">
            Command line interface</a>, which supports most of the UI actions.</p>
        <p>The UI layout <a href="../../user-guide/change-layout/" target="_blank">can be customized</a> and extended using <a href="../../reference/stylesheets/" target="_blank">stylesheets</a>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="alert alert-info">
        <p><em>Note that user interface features are subject to <a href="../administration/acl/">access control</a>. For example,
            the search box will not be visible if the user is not authorized to access the search container.</em></p>

        </p>
        <p>The application title or logo in the top-left always links to the root container of the current application.</p>
        <p><dfn>Search box</dfn> lets users <a href="../documents/#search" title="Search action">search for resources</a>
        within the current application that have the specified keyword in their titles, descriptions etc. Results are shown in a dropdown list.</p>
        <p>Application's <dfn>SPARQL endpoint</dfn> is accessible on the right. It offers a query editor and a result
        view. Learn more about query possibilities in the <a href="../../user-guide/query-data/">Query data</a> section.</p>
        <p>Current application can be switched using a dropdown on the right. Different users have access to
        different applications, depending on their authorizations.</p>
        <div class="alert alert-info">
            <p><em>Due to current web browser limitations, it is not possible to logout using client certificate authentication.
              As a workaround, you can close the browser, and click <span class="btn">Cancel</span> when asked to select a
              certificate the next time.</em></p>

        <h2 id="action-bar">Action bar</h2>

        </p>
        <p>The <span class="btn btn-primary create-action">Create <span class="caret"></span></span> button invokes <a href="#create-edit">create dialog</a> through which
        resources can be <a href="../documents/#create">created</a> as instances of the
        <a href="../administration/model/#classes">classes</a> defined in the model.</p>
        <p>The path leading from the current document up the parent/child hierarchy to the root container is shown in
        the <dfn>breadcrumb bar</dfn>, where the current document is always the last breadcrumb. The user can always
        open any of the ascendant containers by clicking breadcrumbs left from the current one. The icon shows the
        type of the current document (container or item). A label is displayed when the URL currently being browsed is external.</p>
        <p>The breadcrumb bar also provides a dropdown with shortcuts to <a href="../data-management/documents/#hierarchy">system containers</a>:</p>
        <dl>
          <dt>Latest</dt>
          <dd>A container with the latest resources in the application's dataset by creation/modification date</dd>
          <dt>Files</dt>
          <dd>A container for <a href="../documents/#files">file uploads</a></dd>
          <dt>Imports</dt>
          <dd>A container for <a href="../imports/">data imports</a></dd>
          <dt>Queries</dt>
          <dd>A container for end-user SPARQL queries (including <a href="../imports/csv/#vocabulary-conversion">vocabulary
              mappings</a>)</dd>
          <dt>Geo</dt>
          <dd>A container with all resources in the application's dataset that have geographic coordinates</dd>
          <dt>Charts</dt>
          <dd>A container with charts that visualize SPARQL query results</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Further to the right, the action bar displays buttons for <a href="../documents/#manage">performing actions</a> on the current document.</p>
        <p>Last but not least, the settings button provides a link to the <a href="../administration/">administration</a>
        application.</p>
        <div class="alert alert-info">
            <p><em>Only administration users have access to the administration application.</em></p>

    <div>
        <h2 id="document-tree">Document tree</h2>
        <p>Document tree shows the document hierarchy of the dataspace. By clicking on a container, it expands to show its children.</p>
        <p>In a desktop layout mode, the document tree folds out when the mouse is moved to the left edge of the screen. In a responsive layout, it is always shown.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 id="layout-modes">Layout modes</h2>
        <p>A list of possible <dfn>layout modes</dfn> is displayed, and can be switched using, the mode dropdown in
        the action bar. Containers and items are available in different modes.</p>
        <p>Container (page) layout modes:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Content</dt>

            <dt>Properties</dt>
            <dd>The most detailed view showing every property/value of children resources.</dd>

    <div>
        <h2 id="main-content">Main content</h2>
        <p>The main content section is located in the center of the screen. Its contents depend on the current document
