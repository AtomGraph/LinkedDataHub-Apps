    <div>
        <h2 id="dataspaces">Dataspaces</h2>
        <p>The LinkedDataHub URI address space is split into <dfn>dataspaces</dfn>. Every dataspace consists of a pair of LinkedDataHub applications:
            <a href="#end-user-apps">end-user</a> and <a href="#admin-apps">administration</a>.</p>
        <p>The end-user app will be available on the given base URI; the admin app will be available
            at that base URI with <code>admin/</code> appended. The <a href="../administration/acl/#agents">agent</a> that installed the admin dataset will be the application <dfn>owner</dfn>.</p>
        <p>The <dfn>secretary</dfn> is a special agent which represents the software application itself. It is distinct from the owner agent and is used to delegate the owner's access.</p>
        <p class="lead">See also the <a href="../administration/">administration reference</a>.</p>    
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>
        <p>All LinkedDataHub applications have the following traits:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Base URI</dt>
            <dd>Base URI is a URI by which an application can be identified. All request URIs processed by an application are relative to one of its base URIs.</dd>
            <dd>URIs in the <a href="../dataset/">application dataset</a> are usually (but not necessarily) relative to its base URIs.</dd>
            <dt>Service</dt>
            <dd><a href="#services">SPARQL service</a></dd>
            <dt>Namespace ontology</dt>
            <dd><a href="../administration/ontologies/#ontologies">Ontology</a> that defines the terms (classes, properties, constraints etc.) of the application's domain. It can import
                other ontologies from within the application as well as from external documents.</dd>
            <dd>Ontologies as <a href="../administration/ontologies/">managed in the administration</a> application.</dd>
        </dl>
        <div class="alert alert-info">
            <p>Base URI must end with a forward slash (<code>/</code>).</p>
        </div>
        <p>In addition to that, LinkedDataHub applications have one additional property:</p>

                    <p>The base URI of an end-user application is also the base URI of its dataspace.</p>
                    <p>Every end-user application is related to one <a href="#admin-apps">administration application</a>.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3 id="admin-apps">Administration</h3>
                    <p>Every administration application is related to one <a href="#end-user-apps">end-user application</a>. It cannot exist standalone.</p>
                    <p>The base URI(s) of an administration application is the base URI(s) of its end-user application with <code>admin/</code> appended
                        to it. Note that any URIs in the end-user application that are equal or relative to the admin application base URI <em>will not
                        be accessible</em>.</p>
                    <p>Administration application provides means to control the <a href="../administration/ontologies/">domain model</a> and the
                        <a href="../administration/acl/">access control</a> of its end-user application. Only dataspace owners have access to its

                    <h3 id="contexts">Contexts</h3>
                    <p>Contexts are special meta-applications that allow creation of dataspaces (that will belong to the context) and  also list public dataspaces that belong to them.</p>
                    <p>The concept can be compared to <a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.0-doc/config/context.html" target="_blank">servlet context</a>
                        (to which multiple servlets can be added) in Java EE architecture. However, LinkedDataHub concepts and dataspaces are purely RDF data structures and not software artifacts.</p>

        <p>LinkedDataHub imports the <a href="../dataset/#default-datasets">default datasets</a> for each application type
            into its service. The dataset URIs are rebased to be relative to the base URI of the application.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 id="services">Services</h2>
        <p>A service is a persistent SPARQL 1.1-compatible store from which the application's <a href="../dataset/">RDF dataset</a> is accessible over HTTP. LinkedDataHub supports
            generic services as well as triplestore-specific services which support easier configuration and optimized access. HTTP Basic is
            suppported as an authentication scheme. Contact us regarding support for vendor-specific authentication such as API keys.</p>
        <div class="alert alert-info">
            <p>The end-user application service must be able to federate with the administration application service using the
            SPARQL <code>SERVICE</code> keyword.</p>

        <div>
            <h3 id="generic-services">Generic services</h3>
            <p>Generic service has the following properties:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Endpoint</dt>
                <dd>SPARQL 1.1 Protocol endpoint URI</dd>

                <dd>HTTP Basic username (optional)</dd>
                <dt>Password</dt>
                <dd>HTTP Basic password (optional)</dd>
            </dl>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3 id="custom-services">Custom services</h3>
            <p>LinkedDataHub has extension points for vendor-specific SPARQL services, which can be used to implement proprietary authentication schemes, for example.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 id="hierarchy">Document hierarchy</h2>
        <p>The basic structure of resources in an application is analogous to the file system, but built using RDF
            resources and relationships between them instead. There is a hierarchy of <dfn>containers</dfn> (folders),
            which are collections of <dfn>items</dfn> (files) as well as sub-containers (sub-folders). Both containers
            and items are <dfn>documents</dfn>. Items cannot contain other documents.</p>
        <p>The first level of resources in a container is referred to as its <dfn>children</dfn> (of which that container
            is the <dfn>parent</dfn>), while all levels down the hierarchy are collectively referred to as
            <dfn>descendants</dfn>.</p>
        <p>When a user logs in, the application loads its root container (unless a specific URI was requested). From there,
            users can navigate down the resource hierarchy, starting with children of the <dfn>root container</dfn>. At
            any moment there is only one <dfn>current document</dfn> per page, on which <a href="#manage">actions</a> can
            be performed: it can be viewed, edited etc.</p>
