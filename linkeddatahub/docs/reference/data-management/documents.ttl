    <p class="lead">This guide explains the document hierarchy and the basic data management actions.</p>
    <div>
        <h2 id="dataspace">Dataspace</h2>
        <p>The user is always working within the <a href="../../dataspace/#dataspaces">dataspace</a>. A dataspace consists of two
            applications:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>the end-user application</li>
            <li>the administration application which only administration users have access to</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This guide provides the end-user perspective; see <a href="../../administration/">Administration</a> guides for the
            administrator perspective.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 id="hierarchy">Document hierarchy</h2>
        <p>The basic structure of resources in an application is analogous to the file system, but built using RDF
            resources and relationships between them instead. There is a hierarchy of <dfn>containers</dfn> (folders),
            which are collections of <dfn>items</dfn> (files) as well as sub-containers (sub-folders). Both containers
            and items are <dfn>documents</dfn>. Items cannot contain other documents.</p>
        <p>The first level of resources in a container is referred to as its <dfn>children</dfn> (of which that container
            is the <dfn>parent</dfn>, while all levels down the hierarchy are collectively referred to as
            <dfn>descendants</dfn>.</p>
        <p>When a user logs in, the application loads its root container (unless a specific URI was requested). From there,
            users can navigate down the resource hierarchy, starting with children of the <dfn>root container</dfn>. At
            any moment there is only one <dfn>current document</dfn> per page, on which <a href="#manage">actions</a> can
            be performed: it can be viewed, edited etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2 id="manage">Manage documents</h2>
        <p>The following actions can also be performed using the <a href="../../command-line-interface/" target="_blank">command line interface</a>.</p>
        <table class="table table-striped" id="actions">
