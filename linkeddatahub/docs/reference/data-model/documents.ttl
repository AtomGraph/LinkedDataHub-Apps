        <p>The basic structure of resources in a LinkedDataHub <a href="../../dataspace/#applications">application</a> is analogous to the file system, but built using RDF
            resources and relationships between them instead. There is a hierarchy of <dfn>containers</dfn> (folders),
            which are collections of <dfn>items</dfn> (files) as well as sub-containers (sub-folders). Both containers
            (instances of <code>dh:Container</code>) and items (instances of <code>dh:Item</code>) are <dfn>documents</dfn> (instances of <code>foaf:Document</code>). Items cannot contain other documents.</p>
        <p>The first level of resources in a container is referred to as its <dfn>children</dfn> (of which that container
            is the <dfn>parent</dfn>, while all levels down the hierarchy are collectively referred to as
            <dfn>descendants</dfn>.</p>
        <p>When a user logs in, the application loads its root container (unless a specific URI was requested). From there,
            users can navigate down the resource hierarchy, starting with children of the <dfn>root container</dfn>. At
            any moment there is only one <dfn>current document</dfn> per page, on which management actions can
            be performed: it can be viewed, edited etc.</p>
