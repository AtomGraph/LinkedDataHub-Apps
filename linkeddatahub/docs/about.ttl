        <a href="https://atomgraph.com" target="_blank">AtomGraph</a> that fully exploits semantic technologies to help organizations
        overcome data silos and API hell</p>
    <div>
        <h2 id="why-kg">Why Knowledge Graphs?</h2>
        <p>The web and data technologies have changed our world dramatically, but the solutions are still far
        from perfect.</p>
        <div>
            <h3 id="problems">The problems</h3>
            <p>The are multiple problems with the current technological landscape:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Data silos</dt>
                <dd>The relational model, still used in most IT systems, is <em>inflexible</em> as the schema is
                mandatory and <em>hard to change</em>. New kinds of NoSQL databases solve some of its problems but
                increase the number of <em>incompatible</em> systems. As a result, there is no overview over company
                information as the data is <em>scattered</em> across multiple data models and IT systems.</dd>
                <dt>API hell</dt>
                <dd>There are 10,000s of APIs and 100s of file formats. Application integration using APIs is
                inherently point-to-point, and as such it does not scale as the number of connectors <em>grows
                exponentially</em> with the growing number of APIs (in the worst case scenario). Additionally, most web
                applications are not API-driven, therefore developing a frontend web app as well as an API requires
                <em>double effort</em>.</dd>
                <dt>Vendor lock-in</dt>
                <dd>Most NoSQL databases <em>lack standards</em> such as query languages; domain models are baked into
                source code and cannot be easily reused between systems; most APIs define custom vocabularies and file
                formats. All of these factors create dependencies on vendor-specific solutions, which incur substantial
                <em>switching costs</em> for customers.</dd>
            </dl>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3 id="solutions">The solutions</h3>
            <p>The solution is to use semantic technologies to build a uniform Knowledge Graph layer above various physical
            data sources.</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>RDF graph</dt>
                <dd>RDF data model offers unprecedented <em>flexibility</em> by turning siloed data records into a global
                network of interconnected resources. It makes schema optional and offers no-cost merge operation as well
                as a standard query language (SPARQL). Since RDF resources use URIs as built-in global identifiers and have
                machine-readable resource descriptions, RDF Knowledge Graph can be automatically deployed as a web API.</dd>
                <dt>Data hub</dt>
                <dd>Instead of point-to-point integration, Knowledge Graph adopts the hub-and-spoke paradigm, where the RDF 
                database serves as the hub with shared identifiers and vocabularies, while the spokes are RDF connectors
                to databases as well as transformers from various data formats to RDF. Using this approach, integration costs stay
                <em>linear</em> even with the growing number of data sources.</dd>
                <dt>Uniform API</dt>
                <dd><a href="http://atomgraph.github.io/Linked-Data-Templates/" target="_blank">Linked Data Templates</a> technology
                enables read-write access to RDF Knowledge Graphs based on a single <em>generic</em> API, which ensures API
                interoperability and keeps implementation costs fixed. Frontend application development does not require a
                separate effort, as it is simply a UI wrapper that renders the Knowledge Graph API.</dd>
            </dl>
            <p>This simple yet powerful architecture is <em>non-disruptive</em> and future-proof: it builds on existing data
            infrastructure and is based on W3C standards. It enables organizations to ask previously impossible questions,
            get new insights, control data quality across multiple sources, improve SEO and rich search results etc. It also
            keeps data integration costs linear over the long term.</p>

        <h2 id="why-linkeddatahub">Why LinkedDataHub?</h2>
        <p>LinkedDataHub is a Knowledge Graph management system and application platform. After data
          hub architecture is used to solve data integration, LinkedDataHub can be layered on top of it to provide a state of the
          art Knowledge Graph user experience as well as a uniform Knowledge Graph API for machine readable access. It comes in both
          <em>open-source and cloud versions</em> and offers the
          following features:</p>

                <dd>LinkedDataHub uses <a href="http://webid.info" target="_blank">WebID</a>, a universal login and identity protocol for the Web, as the
                    default authentication method. User agents need to sign up only once to authenticate with any application on the
                    platform.</dd>
                <dt>0% code</dt>
                <dd>LinkedDataHub applications are not physical webapps as J2EE ones; they do not need to be implemented in source code
                  and then compiled/interpreted. Like everything within the platform, applications are data resources,
                  created and configured by managing RDF data. A new application can be set up in a <em>matter of minutes</em>.</dd>
                <dt>100% configuration</dt>
                <dd>The structure, appearance, and access rights of an application are completely controlled in the

          <dd>LinkedDataHub supports file uploads and import of CSV data, by mapping it to RDF using SPARQL
            <code>CONSTRUCT</code> queries. Import of XML data is planned.</dd>
          <dt>Data quality control</dt>
          <dd>Consistency of the application's dataset is ensured by validating all incoming RDF data against SPARQL-based
            <a href="../reference/administration/model/#constraints" target="_blank">SPIN constraints</a> (built-in as well as user-defined), which
            are a part of the application's model.</dd>
          <dt>Access control</dt>
          <dd>All access to every document on LinkedDataHub is checked against
            <a href="../reference/administration/acl/" target="_blank">access control</a> rules (built-in as well as user-defined). Unauthorized
            access is denied.</dd>
          <dt>Uniform UX</dt>
          <dd>The <a href="../reference/user-interface/" target="_blank">user experience</a> is consistent throughout the platform; all documents by

          <dt>Remote datasources</dt>
          <dd>An integrated browser component allows exploring remote Knowledge Graph resources without leaving the application.
            We are constantly improving the software to take advantage of the distributed nature of RDF data.</dd>
          <dt>HTTP API</dt>
          <dd>LinkedDataHub's <a href="../reference/http-api/" target="_blank">HTTP API</a> is an implementation of the

          <dt>SEO support</dt>
          <dd>Customizable JSON-LD output allows a mapping of RDF resources to <a href="https://schema.org" target="_blank">schema.org</a>.
            That structured data is <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/intro-structured-data" target="_blank">indexed
